# Waterlogged - Back-end

This repository is the back-end component of the Waterlogged project.

The Waterlogged project aims to create a tool allowing white-water kayakers to :

- Find rivers around them that fit their level
- Getting informations about rivers such as their current levels,  their put in, take out, the weather forecast, the number of people who  paddled this river this year
- Get logs about their previous outings
- Get in contact with other paddlers

Back-end provide data to the front-end component from the other APIs. This component runs with SpringBoot/Maven.
