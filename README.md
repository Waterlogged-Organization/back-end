# Waterlogged - Back-end

This repository is the back-end component of the Waterlogged project.

The Waterlogged project aims to create a tool allowing white-water kayakers to :

- Find rivers around them that fit their level
- Getting informations about rivers such as their current levels,  their put in, take out, the weather forecast, the number of people who  paddled this river this year
- Get logs about their previous outings
- Get in contact with other paddlers

Back-end provide data to the front-end component from the other APIs. This component runs with SpringBoot/Maven.

## How to run the project ?

### Requirements

To run the project, the followings must be installed on the machine :

- Docker
- Docker-compose

You also need a valid API key used both for Google Geocoding and Google Place services.

### Run the project

1. Clone the repository

2. Add your Google API key :

   1. Duplicate the file `src/main/resources/application.properties.example`

   2. Remove the `.example` extension

   3. Edit the new file (i.e. without extension) to add your Google API key :

      ```properties
      googleAPIKey=<your API key>
      ```

3. Run Docker Compose with the following command in the root folder

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. The API is now available on the port 8081
